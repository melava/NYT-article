# NYT-article

The purpose here is to copy the layout of an article of the NY Times (link: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html). My objective is to use mainly grid CSS for positionning.

This exercise is part of the full stack JS cursus of The Odin Project.
